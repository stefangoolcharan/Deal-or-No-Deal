# Deal-or-No-Deal
A program written in C++ which re-creates the classic game Deal or No Deal but with a twist at the end.

The twist is simple yet dangerous. At the end of last round when the player is only left with their case and one to choose from, they are presented with the choice to open their own case, swap it for the last remaining one or, the twist, play a mini game to potentially increase their winnings by twice the amount of their original case. 
However, by doing this they also put themselves at the risk of losing everything entirely if they lose the mini game or winning less than what the banker offered previously. 
It is a strategic bet that must be thought of based on the two remaining values. Once the player has started the game, they will be presented with twelve arithmetic questions that are six multiplication and six division questions (only the quotient could be inputted). 
If the player scores twelve exact, they win double the amount of their case value. If they score six exact, they win Â¾ the amount of their case value. If they score less than six, they lose everything. No going back. All or nothing. 

Let the gambling begin.
